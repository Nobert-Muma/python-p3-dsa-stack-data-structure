# Stack Data Structure.

## Learning Goals

- Define a `Stack` data structure.
- Identify common methods for a `Stack`.
- Identify common use cases for a `Stack`.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Sequence**: a data structure in which data is stored and accessed in a
  specific order.
- **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In
  First Out (LIFO)
- **Index**: the location, represented by an integer, of an element in a
  sequence.
- **Iterable**: able to be broken down into smaller parts of equal size that can
  be processed in turn. You can loop through any iterable object.
- **Slice**: a group of neighboring elements in a sequence.
- **List**: a mutable data type in Python that can store many types of data. The
  most common data structure in Python.
- **Tuple**: an immutable data type in Python that can store many types of data.
- **Range**: a data type in Python that stores integers in a fixed pattern.
- **String**: an immutable data type in Python that stores unicode characters in
  a fixed pattern. Iterable and indexed, just like other sequences.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn what `Stack`s are and what methods they commonly
include. We'll discuss time complexity considerations when using `Stack`s and
provide some common real-world examples of when `Stack`s are used. We'll also
walk through an example algorithm, first coding it without using a `Stack`, and
then with one.

## Defining a Stack

A `Stack` is a linear data structure that allows you to store a list of data of
some sort, and to add and remove values. Values in the stack are processed in
**First In, Last Out** (FILO) order. In other words, the value that was added to
the `Stack` most recently will be the first one removed. This can be contrasted
with another similar data structure, a `Queue`, which is processed in **First
In, First Out** (FIFO) order.

If we consider an airport security checkpoint as a real world example, the stack
of bins is our `Stack`: when a passenger grabs a bin from the stack, it's the
last bin that was added; in other words, **First In, Last Out**. (You can also
think of it as **Last In, First Out**; the two terms are equivalent.) The line
of passengers waiting to pass through security would be our `Queue`: the first
person to join the line will be the first one through the checkpoint (**First
In, First Out**).

It can be useful to think of a `Stack` as a vertical structure, like a stack of
plates: we generally refer to adding items to, and removing them from, the _top_
of the `Stack`:

### Stack vs. list

You may be wondering why we wouldn't just use a list instead of implementing a
`Stack`. After all, lists are also used to store a list of data, and also allow
you to add and remove values. In fact, one way to implement a `Stack` (although
not generally the best way) is by using a list as the underlying data structure
— you'll be doing that in the next lesson.

`Stack`s have several benefits for certain problems when compared to lists.
`Stack`s have a more limited set of methods for interacting with data compared
to lists: with a `Stack`, you can only interact with the element at the _top_,
whereas lists allow you to access and interact with elements at _any_ position.
This restriction is actually a good thing when it comes to solving certain kinds
of problems, since it can guide you to a more elegant and easy-to-understand
solution.

## Stack Methods

The implementation of a `Stack` will vary depending on what's needed, but, at a
minimum, generally includes the following methods:

- `push`: add an element to the top of the stack
- `pop`: remove the element at the top of the stack
- `peek` (or `top`): return the value of the element at the top of the stack
  without removing it

In some implementations, you might also want to include a `limit` attribute, to
indicate the maximum size of the `Stack`.

> Fun Fact: the phrase **stack overflow** was originally coined to describe the
> situation of trying to push an item to a full `Stack` — it isn't just a place
> to find answers to coding questions! The reverse situation — trying to pop an
> item off of an empty `Stack` — is referred to as **stack underflow**.

Some other common methods you might see implemented include:

- `empty`/`full`: return true if the `Stack` is empty/full; false otherwise.
- `search(target)`: return the distance between the top of the stack and the
  target element if it's present; -1 otherwise.
- `size`: return the number of elements contained in the `Stack`.

Other methods are possible as well, of course: the methods the developer chooses
to define in a given implementation of a `Stack` will depend on their particular
needs.

Note also that there is nothing magical about the names of the methods. The
names listed above are typically used by convention — and, as always, sticking
to convention generally makes your code easier to read for other developers. But
if you have a good reason for breaking convention in a particular circumstance,
there's no reason you can't!

### Time Complexity of Stack Methods

With the exception of `search`, all of the `Stack` methods listed above (for
example, pushing an element onto the `Stack`) have time complexity of O(1). The
time complexity for `search` is O(n).

Let's look at an example use of a `Stack`:

```py
def reverse_string(string):
  stack = []

  for char in string:
    stack.append(char)

  reversed = ""
  while stack:
    reversed += stack.pop()

  return reversed


print(reverse_string("hello"))
# => "olleh"

```

Here we are iterating through the string and adding each character to the
`Stack`, which has a time complexity of O(n). Then, we loop through the `Stack`,
pop each character off and add it to the reversed string, again yielding a time
complexity of O(n). This gives O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).

## When To Use a Stack

There are a number of practical use cases for a `Stack`. Some common ones
include:

- The [call stack][call-stack] in computing
- Code compilers checking if brackets are balanced when a program is run
- Browser history and back/forward buttons
- Undo/redo in software programs

A `Stack` can also be used to help traverse a more complex data structure known
as a `Tree`. (We'll learn about `Tree`s a bit later in this section.) For
example, one common use of `Stack`s is in implementing a depth-first search
through a `Tree`.

### Example

Let's take a look at an example to see how we might use a `Stack` in solving a
problem.

We want to write an `evaluate_keystrokes` method that will take as input a
string that represents a series of keystrokes. The string may contain some
number of occurrences of the `<` character, which indicates a backspace. We want
our method to return the "interpreted" version of the string.

For example:

```py
evaluate_keystrokes('abcde<fg<h')
# => 'abcdfh'

evaluate_keystrokes('abcd<<<fg<h')
# => 'afh'

evaluate_keystrokes('<fg<h')
# => 'fh'
```

A solution that doesn't use a `Stack` might look something like this:

```py
def evaluate_keystrokes(string):
  i = len(string) - 1
  result = ""
  skip = 0

  while i >= 0:
    if string[i] == "<":
      skip += 1
      i -= 1
    else:
      if skip > 0:
        i -= skip
        skip = 0
      else:
        result = string[i] + result
        i -= 1

  return result
```

Here, we're iterating through our string from back to front and using a
placeholder variable (`skip`) to keep track of how many times we need to
backspace by skipping over characters. If we don't need to backspace, we simply
add the current character to our `result` variable.

Now let's take a look at how we might approach this problem using a `Stack`:

```py
def evaluate_keystrokes(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "<":
            if len(stack) != 0:
                stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)

    result = ""
    while stack:
        result = stack.pop() + result

    return result
```

Every time we encounter the `<`, we "erase" the previous character by `pop`ping
it off the stack, but only if the stack is not empty. We need to check for an
empty stack to handle the special case of `<` being the first character in the
string. By the end, all the characters that don't get "erased" remain in the
`stack`, so we simply `pop` them off and add them to the `result` string.

This problem is one that lends itself pretty naturally to using a `Stack`,
resulting in code that is simpler and easier to read.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about the `Stack` data structure and the methods that
an implementation of a `Stack` usually includes. We also talked about some
real-world use cases for a `Stack` and went through an example algorithm. In the
next lesson, you'll tackle implementing a `Stack`.
